# Off-Grid Encrypted Communication System (In Progress)

This repository contains the code and documentation for building an **Off-Grid Encrypted Communication System** using the **HaltecV3** board and **Meshtastic** software. The system allows users to communicate securely without relying on cell towers, Wi-Fi, or power infrastructure, making it useful in emergency situations, remote locations, or during network outages.

## Overview

The project leverages the **HaltecV3** hardware, which integrates seamlessly with **Meshtastic**, a mesh networking software. This combination enables long-range, low-power communication using LoRa (Long Range) technology, allowing encrypted messaging between devices. The primary goal of the system is to provide a secure, resilient, and decentralized communication platform that remains functional in off-grid scenarios.

### Key Features

- **Off-grid operation:** Communication without cell towers, internet, or electricity.
- **Encryption:** Messages are securely encrypted to ensure privacy.
- **Mesh network:** Devices automatically relay messages to extend range and improve reliability.
- **Low power consumption:** Suitable for battery or solar-powered setups.
- **LoRa technology:** Long-range communication in various environments (urban, rural, remote).

## Hardware Requirements

1. **HaltecV3 Board**: The core hardware for communication.
2. **LoRa Antenna**: Required for long-range communication.
3. **Power Supply**: USB or battery pack (solar power can also be used).
4. **MicroSD Card (optional)**: For storing additional logs or configurations.
5. **Additional Nodes**: Multiple HaltecV3 boards for creating the mesh network.

## Software Requirements

- **Meshtastic Firmware**: The software powering the mesh network communication. Can be installed on the HaltecV3 board.
- **Meshtastic Python CLI**: Used for managing and configuring devices.
- **Meshtastic Android/iOS App**: Optional, but useful for viewing messages and configuring nodes via a smartphone.
- **PySerial**: Required for flashing firmware and communicating with the device over USB.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Flash Meshtastic Firmware

Follow these steps to flash the Meshtastic firmware onto the HaltecV3 board:

1. Download the latest version of the Meshtastic firmware from the [official Meshtastic website](https://meshtastic.org/).
2. Connect the HaltecV3 board to your computer via USB.
3. Use the Meshtastic Python CLI to flash the firmware:
    ```bash
    pip install meshtastic
    meshtastic --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --flash
    ```

### 2. Configure the Device

Once the firmware is installed:

1. Use the Meshtastic Python CLI to set the device parameters:
    ```bash
    meshtastic --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --seturl "https://link.to.mesh.network"
    ```
2. You can also configure parameters such as device name, encryption keys, and channel frequency.

### 3. Test the Network

To test the communication between two or more devices:

1. Ensure all devices are within range and powered on.
2. Use the Meshtastic app or CLI to send encrypted messages between devices.
3. Messages will be relayed across nodes if they are out of direct communication range, forming a mesh network.

## Usage

1. **Sending Messages:**
   - Use the Meshtastic app or CLI to send encrypted messages across the mesh network.
   - Messages will be encrypted end-to-end, ensuring secure communication.
   
2. **Mesh Relay:**
   - Devices automatically forward messages to extend range.
   - Messages will hop between nodes until they reach their destination.

3. **Power Management:**
   - The system is designed for low power consumption, making it ideal for solar or battery operation.
   - Consider using sleep modes or deep sleep configurations for extended deployments.

4. **Additional Configurations:**
   - Add GPS modules to devices to include location tracking.
   - Modify the mesh network parameters (e.g., channel frequencies, transmission power) as needed.
